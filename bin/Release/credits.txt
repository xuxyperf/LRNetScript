Beyond the ~40K lines of C# I wrote, Fiddler depends on the work of a number of other companies and individuals:
Some of Fiddler's icons were generously provided under Creative Commons from the FatCow.com free icon set. 
Fiddler is installed using the excellent and freeware NSIS Installer. 
Fiddler's HexView inspector is based around a forked (early version) of what is now the HexEditor control, open-sourced on SourceForge.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/hexbox/
Fiddler uses the commercial Xceed Libraries for compressing SAZ files and compressing/decompressing web traffic. http://xceed.com/
The Quantum Whale Editor.NET component is used for the SyntaxView Inspector and FiddlerScript Editors.  http://www.qwhale.net/products/editor.htm
